title: Return Of Helvetica
description: Out with the old, in with the new. Helvetica has always been my favorite and has been brought back with a vengance.

A new year, a new look. I played with using a big serif font and a very
minimalist design but went back to my beloved Helvetica. Big, bold and boring
but it's what I like being a slightly aged and apparently uncool developer.
