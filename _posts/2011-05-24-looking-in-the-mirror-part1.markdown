description: UsesThis gives a similar insight in to how some of your most inspirational developers work as dotfiles. The difference being it transcends the boundary of a shell to a much greater degree.

I find it quite interesting to see how other people who and what tools
they use. Whether it's reading about [Chris
Wanstrath](http://chris.wanstrath.usesthis.com/) rave about his
[Logitech MX518 mouse](http://amzn.to/m6hWhi), finding out [Tom
Preston-Werner](http://tom.preston-werner.usesthis.com/) has some kind
of twisted house fetish or reading about whether my favourite OSS
contributor uses some of the same tools I do, I find this kind of
insight in to who others get their shit done truly fascinating.

I don't think I'll be doing an interview for [UsesThis](http://usesthis.com)
anytime soon (maybe when I have a few thousand followers on
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/jamesconroyfinn) and build a Rails-like
framework for MacRuby development) so instead I'll post a few
screenshots and share some of my hidden OS X gems.

If you haven't seen the
[solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) theme I'd highly
recommend it. I use it in [MacVim](http://code.google.com/p/macvim/) and
[iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/) everyday in and out of work.  I find it
to be very easy on the eyes without being wishy washy. That's the
technical term.
