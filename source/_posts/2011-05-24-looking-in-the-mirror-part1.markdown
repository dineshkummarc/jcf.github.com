I find it quite interesting to see how other people who and what tools they use. Whether it's reading about [Chris Wanstrath](http://chris.wanstrath.usesthis.com/) rave about his [Logitech MX518 mouse](http://amzn.to/m6hWhi), finding out [Tom Preston-Werner](http://tom.preston-werner.usesthis.com/) has some kind of twisted house fetish or reading about whether my favourite OSS contributor uses some of the same tools I do, I find this kind of insight in to who others get their shit done truly fascinating.

I don't think I'll be doing an interview for [UsesThis](http://usesthis.com) anytime soon (maybe when I have a few thousand followers on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/jamesconroyfinn) and build a Rails-like framework for MacRuby development) so instead I'll post a few screenshots and share some of my hidden OS X gems.

If you haven't seen the [solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) theme I'd highly recommend it. I use it in [MacVim](http://code.google.com/p/macvim/) and [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/) everyday in and out of work.  I find it to be very easy on the eyes without being wishy washy. That's the technical term.
