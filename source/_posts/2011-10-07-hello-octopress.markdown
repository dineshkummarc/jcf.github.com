In case you haven't heard of [Octopress][], it's a fantastic static-site generator built on top of [Jekyll][].

I've been using Jekyll to build [jamesconroyfinn.com][] for sometime now and have been tickering with styles, layouts and features all along. Now with Octopress I feel like I've reached a point where I'm satisfied with the list of features, and the look of the site as a whole.

## Features

Octopress offers some great features including:

* [HTML5 Video Tag][] - easily post images with class names and titles
* [Backtick Code Block][] - for simple lightweight code sharing
* [Code Block][] - for sharing code with titles and links
* [Include Code][] - embed code from your filesystem with a download link
* [Gist Tag][] - automatically downloads and embeds Github gists
* [jsFiddle][] - embeds code from jsFiddle
* [Image Tag][] - easily post images with class names and titles
* [Render Partial][] - insert any file into another post or page
* [Block Quote][] - generate beautiful, semantic block quotes
* [Pull Quote][] - generate CSS only pull quotes â€” no duplicate data, no javascript
* [Category Generator][] - generates archive pages for each blog category
* [Include Array][] - includes an array of partials specified in the _config.yml

## Configuration

Configuring your site when it's powered by Octopress is really simple.  After you clone your Octopress repo you're provided with a Rakefile full of helpful tasks to create new posts, new pages, download the provided theme, start customising, and then [deploy to an enviable list of hosts][].

I've tweaked things a fair bit but about 90% of the markup produced comes straight from Octopress.

## Tweaks

You can check out the changes I've made on [Github][] if you're interested.

You'll find I have overidden a number of styles to get the header looking the way I want, added links to the footer, attempted to hide the sidebar at all times, and injected a smattering of Helvetica Neue.

## Thanks

I have to thank [Brandon Mathis][] for all of his hardwork starting Octopress and to all those who have [contributed][] to making it what it is.
