I'm a little bit obsessed with dotfiles. I like looking at your dotfiles. I find it fascinating being able to get an insight in to how you work and to some degree how your brain works. Github is overflowing with people's configuration files. If you search Github for [dotfiles][] there are over 100 pages of results from the likes of [Ryan Bates][], [Mislav Marohnić][], and [me](http://github.com/jcf/dotfiles).

## Origins

I started my dotfiles based upon Ryan Bates' setup because I liked his simple use of `rake` to soft link configuration files. Soft-linking your dotfiles means updates are instantaneous and all your files hang around in an encapsulated location readily available via a [`cdot`](http://github.com/jcf/dotfiles/blob/master/zsh/aliases#L6) command.

I ended up refactoring the installer to use a more object-orientated approach to linking files and even had my 'new improved' rake task read my Github token but the more I looked at it the more I thought it was an overengineered solution to an incredibly simple problem.  

Luckily I stumbled upon [Mislav Marohnić][]'s dotfiles and in it found an [installer](http://errtheblog.com/posts/89-huba-huba) created by [Chris Wanstrath][]. It's ultra-simple and very easy to work with, which is why I fell in love with it!

## Features

My [dotfiles][] include a load of ZSH configuration files, which add useful aliases for git and support RVM and Ruby on Rails development as well as including the best Vim plugins I've found in the few years I've been hacking with Vim.

### git

I've borrowed, written and stolen a lot of `git` aliases and scripts from all over the place in the last few years. I've listed some interesting tidbits below.

- `git last` Prints the last commit
- `git db` Delete a local and remote branch in one command
- `git lg` Print a list of commits with relative commit dates

And there are loads more, which can be found in my [gitconfig](http://github.com/jcf/dotfiles/blob/master/gitconfig).

### zsh

I always use Z-Shell. I love it and wouldn't want to have to switch back to use Bash. I love the brilliant completion system, the fantastic globbing support and mind-boggling filtering available right on the command-line.

You might notice I've got custom window and tab titles, a mini left-hand prompt and although you can't see it above I have a right-hand prompt that includes the current git branch (visit the full-size image and you'll see the right-hand prompt).

I use a lot of aliases including `gs` which is an alias for `git status -sb`. Something I like because it's succinct and only shows me what I need to know.

I also have global aliases for grepping and lessing output, which I've pasted below.

{% codeblock lang:sh %}
A='|ack'
G='|grep'
H='|head'
L='|less'
N='&>/dev/null&'
T='|tail'
W='|wc'
{% endcodeblock %}

As far as I'm aware this is a feature not available in Bash, although I might be wrong.

### Ruby & IRB

My [irbrc][] has a few useful methods and tricks that might be of interest. I'm a particular fan of my cutdown version of Giles Bowkett's work to launch vim from IRB in order to ease editing longer bits of Ruby.

There's a nicely wrapped up [interactive_editor](http://github.com/jberkel/interactive_editor) gem you might be interested in using if you decide you want the same behaviour but with multiple editor support.

I stole `quick` from Evan Phoenix I think. It was definitely one of the Rubinius guys.

{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
def quick(repetitions = 100, &block)
  require 'benchmark'
    Benchmark.bmbm do |b|
      b.report { repetitions.times(&block) }
    end
  nil
end

quick(1000) { 'string' << ' two three' }
quick(1000) { 'string' + ' two three' }
{% endcodeblock %}

## Conclusion

There are a lot more customisations I use daily and I haven't even touched on what I've done to vim via my [dotfiles][]; that's for another day.

Feel free to email me or send me a message through Github if you like something in my [dotfiles][], notice a problem or have something to contribute.
